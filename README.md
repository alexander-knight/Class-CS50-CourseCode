# Class-CS50-CourseCode
Code written for Harvard's CS50 Course, Intro to Computer Science

Notes to self;
  1. Please dont forget to link the cs50 library when compiling your program. 
    use " clang (source code name).c -lcs50 -o (assembly code name)
    "-l" indicates to link to the specified library (in this case, the CS50 library. 
    "-o" to assign output its common name. wonder why assembly code output isnt ".acout"  
  2. learn the linux directory commands (cd, rm, etc)
